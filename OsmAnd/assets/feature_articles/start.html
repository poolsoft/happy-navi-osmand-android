<h1>Begin with OsmAnd</h1>
<p>When you launch OsmAnd for the first time, all the parameters will be set to default settings. You can configure them by changing features in the menu. As you launch the app, you'll see the dashboard - a  starting screen with different cards containing information about different groups of settings or files. The dashboard shows your Favourites (favourite places), your GPX tracks list, the plugins information, etc.</p>

<p>Also, you have to download a World basemap. It is a basic map that will later help you view the maps of the regions and countries.
The free version of OsmAnd allows 10 free downloads. After the map is downloaded, please tap the 'back' button to go to the map screen.</p>
<p>The OsmAnd+ version allows unlimited downloads and map updates with all the new details. The application uses Open Street Map resources - the maps created by contributors from all over the world. People add new items to the map, refine the details and delete the points of interest (POI) that are no longer there. Thus, the updates will provide the freshest information available.
To download the map of the region you need, go to Settings - Manage map files - All downloads and choose the one you need.</p>

<h4>Driving region</h4>
<p>This parameter will affect the units of measure used on the map,  the appearance of the speed limit sign shown when navigating, and right-hand or left-hand driving.</p>
<p>Units of measure: Select kilometres/metres, miles/feet, or miles/yards as desired. This affects all distance and speed displays and announcements. You can also change this later in Settings - General Settings - Driving region and Settings - General Settings - Units of measure.</p>

<p>To use the navigation to its fullest, you have to download the file with voice prompts in your language. To do that, please go to Settings - General - Voice prompts and get the language you speak. If your language is not on the default list, press Install more to install the one you need.</p>
<p>To choose navigation language, go to Settings - Navigation - Voice guidance. Please prefer a synthesized (tts) voice over a pre-recorded voice, if possible for your language. Synthesized voices are more flexible and can pronounce distances and times in finer steps, they also pronounce street names and your waypoint names, which pre-recorded voices can not do.</p>

<p>If you select a tts voice, you need to have a respective text-to-speech engine in your Android operating system. These are partly included in Android or can be installed separately. Please go to your Android (device) settings, find Language and keyboard / Text-to-speech output or similar. Select or install an engine, then also install the language support for the language you need, this may be an extra setting or small download.</p>
<p>Please test ('Listen to an example' or similar test button provided) if your Android tts is working ok. Then you may also test if your OsmAnd voice prompts have been selected properly by going to Settings &#8212; General &#8212; OsmAnd development &#8212; Test voice prompts in OsmAnd. (OsmAnd debugging plugin must be activated to see the setting).</p>
