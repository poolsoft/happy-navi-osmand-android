<h1>How to use the map</h1>
<p>OsmAnd gives you great possibilities for using the maps. You can customize them, download different types of maps and even edit them!</p>
<p>We recommend you download the World basemap before proceeding. You can then move on to downloading the map of your region or the one you're planning to travel to. OsmAnd uses the Open Street Maps, the maps made by the open-source project, a community of volunteer contributors who work on the maps every day.
This is why they are so up-to-date. They&#39;re also quite compact and rapidly rendered as the basic OsmAnd map is a vector-type map, which means it carries vector representation of the map details rendered together on your device as opposed to the tile or raster maps that are&#39;pictures&#39;.</p>

<p>You can change your map style. It is set to OsmAnd by default, but you can pick the one that fits your needs. &#39;Nautical&#39; and &#39;Winter and ski&#39; styles are made to be used with the corresponding plugins.</p>
