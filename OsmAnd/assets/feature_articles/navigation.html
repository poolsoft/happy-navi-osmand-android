<h1>How to use navigation</h1>
<p>The navigation function allows you to reach your destination easily using voice guidance (optional).</p>
<p>To start the navigation, you need to use the navigation button on the map screen. Next, you'll need to set the starting point and the destination. As for the starting point, you can choose your current location, Favorite location, select a point on the map or use an address. You can also set a starting point by long tapping on the map and choosing 'Set as destination' in the menu box. It is the same with the destination point. As soon as your  points are selected, the app will create a route and will start guiding you after you tap Go.</p>

<p>You can customize your route to avoid certain streets or types of roads. To do that, just create a navigation route as usual, then enter the navigation settings in your navigation menu. You can choose to avoid toll roads, unpaved roads, ferries, shuttle train, motorways and border crossing or just select the shortest way. But you can also avoid a certain street. Maybe there are construction works or a traffic jam or anything that makes you want to avoid that section of road. Just tap the button on the right in your navigation settings menu and select the roads to avoid on the map. Your selection will work for current route only &#8212; the next time you'll be able to ride that way as usual.</p>
